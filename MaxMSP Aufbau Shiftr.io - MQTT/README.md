# MaxMSP Aufbau Shiftr.io
The German word "Aufbau" is here primarily understood as a process of establishing interoperational constitution between Max/MSP and other programming languages. This constitutional process is realized through three interpretations of the word "Aufbau". In this part we will examine the Aufbau between Max/MSP and MQTT Broker [Shiftr.io](https://shiftr.io/).

## Set-up

The creator of Shiftr.io [Joël Gähwiler](https://github.com/256dpi) has already worked with interfacing Max/MSP with Shiftr.io via an [mxj object](https://github.com/256dpi/max-mqtt). This mxj object wraps the Java MQTT Client, and allows max-patches to communicate around the world using an MQTT Broker like shiftr.io.

Unfortunatly Gähwilers Max External has not been maintained since dec. 2019 and I have not been able to get it to work. Luckily there is another way of using MQTT with Max/MSP using the newly added Node for Max.
