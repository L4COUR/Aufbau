# The Aufbau Interpretations
The German word "Aufbau" is here primarily understood as a process of establishing interoperational constitution between Max/MSP and other programming languages. This constitutional process is realized through three interpretations of Aufbau.

### 1) Set-up
In this first interpretation we establish the initial connection between Max/MSP and the other given program. During set-up the minimum amount of syntax required to connect the programs together are written and tested in order to ensure a stable connection.

### 2) Structure
In this second interpretation we analyse the inherent oppertunities of the two programs. In what ways can these two programs benefit from each other. what are the benefits of using one program over the other to carry out a certain task? This step is about exploring what is possible with an established interoperational constitution between the programs.

### 3) Compose
In this final interpretation we are able to compose ideas through the joint functionality of the interoperational programs. Because we have established a connection through the Set-up and explored the possibilities through Structure, we are now able to compose an interopertaional program which utilizes the ideas we may have discovered through structure.

## Determining ways of connecting Max/MSP to other programming languages
In this repository I want to build an archive of multiple programming langauges that Max/MSP can connect with. The goal is to create a resource for users of the Max/MSP software developed by Cycling 74, which will allow them to more easily find ways of connecting and discovering new ways of using Max/MSP.

Each of the ways of connecting Max/MSP to a given program, will use my Aufbau interpretations as a scaffolding for the guides sections. This means that each guide will start of by a Set-up section, Structure section and finally a Compose section. by following each of these section it will give the reader an idea of how to quickly setup the connection, what the possibilites of doing so is, and an example of how this connection can be utilized in practice.
